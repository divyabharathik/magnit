EmpSat is a modern Angular application designed to assess employee satisfaction within an organization. This web-based tool features a user-friendly interface that displays six questions one by one, gathering data on various aspects of job satisfaction. Once all questions are answered, the employee satisfaction index is calculated and displayed on the screen.

EmpSat utilizes a Spring Boot Java backend to process data. The backend provides the necessary tools for handling requests and responses from the frontend, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience for the user.

The frontend of EmpSat is built using Angular, a powerful web framework that provides a flexible and scalable solution for building complex web applications. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a minimalist layout that focuses on the questions being asked. The questions themselves are designed to be thought-provoking and comprehensive, covering a wide range of topics related to job satisfaction.

As the user answers each question, the application provides real-time feedback on the answers given. This helps the user to identify any areas where they may be struggling or feeling less satisfied, giving them the opportunity to explore these areas further. Once all questions have been answered, the application calculates the employee satisfaction index, which is displayed on the screen. This index provides a clear and concise overview of the user's satisfaction level, allowing them to easily identify any areas where improvement may be needed.
